# NOTE: This pipeline depends on the following variable groups: 

# Name of variable group                  Keys inside variable group
# ----------------------                  --------------------------
# redgate_global_vars                     FLYWAY_LICENSE_KEY
# redgate_pipeline_vars                   BASELINE_VERSION, FIRST_UNDO_SCRIPT, AGENT_POOL
# redgate_target_database_credentials     userName, password, target_database_JDBC, databaseName, check_JDBC, check_userName, check_password

# redgate_build_credentials               userName, password, target_database_JDBC, databaseName

# Every target database will need its own variable group, which is referenced in a YML deployment script
# The default is to include the agent pools inside a pipeline definition, to accommodate multiple agent pools.
# If appropriate, the agent pool definition could be moved to the global variable group (or a target specific variable group)

# PARELLELISM
# Pay close attention to the "dependsOn" flag - this determines which block follows each other. 
# It's possible to parallelize dpelyments by using multiple agent pools and the "dependsOn" flag.
